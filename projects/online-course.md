SIMLab creates and hosts web-based trainings to support civil society organizations in their efforts to use mobile technology to broaden citizen participation in democratic processes. Based on years of training experience using FrontlineSMS and FrontlineCloud, we developed an innovative, guided curriculum aimed at exploring applications of mobile technology for accessing information and monitoring civic engagement, as well as outlining challenges in the use of technology to engage members of society. The online course caters to those working in low-connectivity areas, and teaches participants how to set-up and use FrontlineSMS and FrontlineCloud, as well as how to design a program incorporating SMS.
