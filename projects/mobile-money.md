SIMLab is working to improve economic livelihoods in rural Kenya through mobile money management tools. Over a two-year period, which started in January of 2014, the project works with 40 rural NGOs, Savings and Cooperative Credit Organizations (SACCOs), schools, and small or medium sized enterprises (SMEs) to implement Payments, a mobile money management tool developed as part of the FrontlineSMS suite of tools. SIMLab's partner organizations are directly serving marginalized communities in Kenya including at-risk youth, women and children and people living with HIV/AIDS. SIMLab provides organizations with a comprehensive on-site training, where we work together to discover gaps in payment processes, communication streams and financial reporting and reconciliation.
