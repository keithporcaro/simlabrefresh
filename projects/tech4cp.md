This project seeks to understand the role of information and technology in post-conflict contexts, focusing on different dimensions of human security, accountability of formal and informal security actors, humanitarian and long-term development considerations.  Research is taking place in the conflict-affected and post-conflict environments of Afghanistan, Pakistan, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, Serbia, Kenya, Somalia, South Sudan, Guatemala, Nicaragua, and El Salvador. The SIMLab team will contribute to methodology, manage potential pilot initiatives, and serve as a consortium advisor on ICT context, ethics, and methodology in each context in addition to managing potential pilot initiatives associated with research.
