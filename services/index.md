#Our working principles:
Our mission and ethos, coupled with deep experience, shape key principles that inform and guide the work we take on and how we carry it out:

* Local ownership of technology is critical for a project's long-term viability;
* Start from the problem and the context, not the technology;
* Include as many people as possible by opening multiple lines of communication for engagement and feedback;
* Develop a realistic funding model and exit plan;
* Use existing platforms wherever possible, and contribute to the global toolkit where it’s not, building for replicability and respecting the real cost of software development, support and maintenance;
* Make robust, appropriate efforts to assess and document outcomes and impact;
* Share learning and methodologies under open licenses.

##Project scoping and requirements-gathering
Many projects begin with the desire to change a process in a place or organization; with a clear goal in mind but no firm set of requirements. SIMLab can help you to get from an idea to a plan, through participatory workshops, requirements gathering, prototyping and research.

SIMLab can help to **investigate and assess the technological, political, economic, and social contexts that a project targets**, from mapping the infrastructure and power relationships of key stakeholders and decision-makers to analyzing and assessing the infrastructure that supports it.

Drawing on our sector-level experience and expertise in context assessment and evaluation, SIMLab is available to help you map out how information flows through a system now, and how that should change. Together we’ll identify barriers to accessibility for marginalized groups, from cost, to time, to technology access, in order to help decision-makers and advocates optimize resource allocation and improve the system.

##Communications context and environment assessment
The number of mobile networks and data carriers in country, their relationship with the state, relative coverage and level of sophistication all have an impact on the systems that an inclusive technology project will be able to use effectively. SIMLab works with its partners to assess environmental factors that may impact their projects.
Information and communications context, infrastructure, accessibility, limitations and points of risk for different populations


###Community communications and information needs and habits

Technology habits, customs, and needs of different populations, agencies or entities
Digital divide, inclusion and exclusion of low-connectivity populations 
incentives

###Organization strategy and implementing capacity  

We have particular expertise in understanding the digital divide, and how to account for variable levels of technology access among marginalized populations. Building services and systems that are accessible to all, no matter their level of connectivity, is a fundamental part of SIMLab’s ethos and approach.   

* Interoperability options for existing technology platforms and tools
* Cost-benefit of adopting or building new platforms versus adaptation or integration of existing platforms for specific programs 
* Technology and political economy factors to consider in project scoping, planning, implementation or partnering
* Power relations of key actors involved in program from decision-makers to service providers to contractors and communities both in/directly affected by initiative



##Technology-focussed pilot development, Implementation Support and Change Management
A project that tests key assumptions without being prohibitively expensive is a tough balance to strike. SIMLab is available to provide advice or hands-on support to organizations and public agencies engaging with technology in existing programs or designing new projects using inclusive technologies. Our capabilities include:    

* Identifying gaps in service delivery, partnerships and outreach via stakeholder and supply-chain mapping, desk research and analysis;
* Investigating interoperability and cost-benefit of existing and planned technology platforms and tools;
* Managing software development to build, tailor or connect platforms or tools*;
* Developing and managing relationships with technical and mobile infrastructure partners;
* Managing a technology rollout, from installation to remote (or local) troubleshooting support;
* Training users and trainers, and developing resources to continue learning after the training has ended;
* Forecasting how a project impacts organizational change needs, including human resources, budgetary adjustments, data integrity and quality control;
* Documentation, monitoring and evaluating pilot with a mind toward sustainable adoption and use over time

##Monitoring, Evaluation, and Data Analysis
SIMLab is available to design and implement comprehensive monitoring and evaluation plans, even as plans change with new information, and new choices arise. Our approach is holistic, examining not only the role of technology in an intervention and in a wider community, but the design of its rollout, the effectiveness of training on staff and service providers, the availability of troubleshooting assistance for anyone using technology tools and platforms, the local ownership of the project, and the ability for institutions or X to respond. 

We build monitoring and evaluation approaches that run throughout the project cycle, from baseline studies to mid-term and final evaluations. In addition to monitoring the use of inclusive technology itself, SIMLab can help integrate inclusive technology into M&E efforts, from data collection to community feedback. We can also train staff on basic monitoring principles, and how to use and own inclusive technologies and techniques for monitoring projects. Finally, SIMLab is available to analyze, interpret, and synthesize data, and help crystalize your evaluations into permanent, scalable learnings.

#Documentation, Dissemination, and Community Building
We're not the only ones who are working to do good with technology, so we work to help everyone use technology better. SIMLab is available to **convene and facilitate events and discussions on critical issues in the field**. We also offer **custom training courses hosted on our online learning platform,** which provides low-bandwidth peer-supported professional development on technological and non-technological components of inclusive technology. 

Every project offers the opportunity to extract valuable lessons, not only for your organization, but for others in the community. Sometimes, those opportunities are lost, whether for a lack of time, budget, or data. We're available to **document and capture lessons from past projects, and disseminate them to the larger community**, or **develop bespoke guides and tools, such as our Data Integrity Guide, that synthesize past lessons, rigorous research and analysis, and current best practices into actionable, practical guidance**. SIMLab is working to develop a **community resource library** that will provide a common home for the valuable lessons being uncovered every day in inclusive technology projects around the world. 

#Systems Development and Accessibility Auditing

#Organizational Strategy
SIMLab can facilitate and support the holistic integration of technology into your organization's strategy. As technology becomes increasingly fundamental to your work, we can help you intelligently adapt to this sea change, from sharing information on best practices and context assessment frameworks to developing project evaluation methodologies and determining what success looks like for a single technology implementation, or an entire organization.

#Data Ethics in Social Change
Through our collaborations with implementers all over the world, we help clients and partners understand how to safeguard themselves, their staff and their end users, as projects increasingly involve gathering and storing potentially sensitive, sometimes tightly-regulated information, in unclear or unstable legal and ethical environments. We  work to shed light on the ethical issues inherent in proliferating data and technology use for social change and integrate what we find into our holistic frameworks for implementing inclusive technology within systems and services. SIMLab is available to work with researchers, practitioners, platform providers, and implementing organizations to develop and implement best practices for informed consent and ethical data collection, management and use.
