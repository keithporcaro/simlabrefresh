“All the land records against this wall have been scanned.” Stacks of land records–browning paper tied together with string–lined the walls, the tables, the shelves. White receipts with markered labels flopped out of some of them; processed and scanned. The tahasildar beamed, visibly proud at the progress his office had made. Still, stacks of titles remained, and still more remained unrecorded. And any new records would also be delivered on paper, awaiting digitization.

Aggregating and opening data presents opportunities for deepening civic engagement, addressing decades-long environmental coordination challenges, or highlighting inefficient institutional processes and procedures, among many other potential uses, benefits and information gains. The same data, branded as a public good, is also the subject of many debates regarding risks, agency, and privacy among others. There is a rising need to sort out the ethics of use and power dynamics over decision-making when it comes to open/ing data for ‘development’. <a class="pink" href="/simlabrefresh/blog/2015/06/03/open-data">...</a></p>

Despite the wide range of social and legal services available in American cities, it’s not always easy for a person to find the right service provider—or often, set of providers—who can help. Service providers, from lawyers to social workers to case managers, have deep expertise helping people solve problems, but sometimes, it may not be obvious that someone should, say, call a lawyer in addition to a food bank if they receive a letter that food stamp benefits have been cut off.  A single story may require the help of multiple experts, and multiple services, in order to meet a person’s need. <a class="pink" href="/simlabrefresh/blog/2015/05/21/first-resort">...</a></p>

As some of you may know, we’ve had many exciting new developments over the last few months, some of which were covered in our first blog post <a href="http://simlab.org/blog/2014/09/02/welcome-to-SIMLab/">here</a>. SIMLab’s focus on helping organizations to use inclusive technologies to build systems and services that are accessible, responsive, and resilient means that we’re now tool agnostic, but many of our case study resources for a while will continue to draw on our work with the Frontline product set.

I was recently in Kisumu, a semi-rural area on the coast of Lake Victoria in Western Kenya. I was there for ten days; training organizations on our mobile payments software, collecting indicators to monitor our DFID project and connecting with organizations to work with in the future. One of the places I spent the most time over the week was Support for Tropical Initiatives in Poverty Alleviation (<a href="http://www.stipakenya.org/">STIPA</a>), which is an amazing organization with projects in microfinance, health insurance, and economic opportunity programs. My time at STIPA was made very worthwhile by the dedicated, knowledgeable and passionate staff. We’ll be working closely with STIPA as they merge two of their major programs, Community Based Health Financing and Village Savings and Loaning to begin using mobile payments. They’re two very impactful projects with unique challenges and potential gains, more of which we’ll be highlighting in future posts.

ICT4D and M4D as fields are both exciting and clumsy, still in their infancy and most consistent in how quickly they are changing. The<a href="http://mandetech.org/agenda-nyc/"> M&amp;E Tech Deep Dive in New York</a> in early October 2014 mustered up familiar conversations around monitoring and evaluation, as well as around ICT4D. Beyond the use of ICTs <em>for</em> M&amp;E, finding common ground on the evaluation <em>of</em> ICTs was challenging. There is wide consensus that technology is not a silver bullet, and further, that it simply can’t be separated from the context in which it operates or is applied. How then, can we think about monitoring and evaluating the role of a particular ICT or digital platform in the context of a larger initiative?

In a forward-thinking, but arguably optimistic recent shift, donors are increasingly encouraging grantees to default to digital or cashless operations for themselves and their partners. USAID and Nethope have gone so far as to require future grantees to make the shift to e-payments in their operations and programs, unless they can make the case that cashless solutions are inappropriate in their specific context. <a class="pink" href="/simlabrefresh/blog/2014/11/17/digital-by-default-too-much-too-soon">...</a></p>

Figuring out a role for technology in rural health service delivery, urban utility provision, anti-corruption, humanitarian relief efforts, or group lending initiatives is not just useful, it’s increasingly inevitable. The rise of ICT4D and M4D approaches has revived questions and debates that have confronted international development practitioners for decades.  Asking ‘what works’ is one of these questions. Intended as a sounding board for deeper inquiry, it often fosters a search for blueprints instead. <a class="pink" href="/simlabrefresh/blog/2014/11/06/what-works-in-ict4d-and-m4d-questions-as-jargon">...</a></p>

Evaluating the use of ICTs—which are used for a variety of projects, from legal services, coordinating responses to infectious diseases, media reporting in repressive environments, and transferring money among the unbanked or voting—can hardly be reduced to a check-list. At SIMLab, our past nine years with FrontlineSMS has taught us that isolating and understanding the impact of technology on an intervention, in any sector, is complicated. ICTs change organizational processes and interpersonal relations. They can put vulnerable populations at risk, even while improving the efficiency of services delivered to others.  ICTs break. Innovations fail to take hold, or prove to be unsustainable.

At SIMLab, we’re intent on examining the challenges of setting up communications technology projects in international aid and development from a practitioner’s perspective. The first few projects have arisen from our work with clients and Frontline users, many of whom are asking similar questions. For example, we’ll be looking at how to isolate and effectively monitor the impact of the use of technology on an intervention and on an organization’s functioning—and we’ll have more to share on that in the coming weeks.

Well, this is an exciting day. Welcome to the Social Impact Lab. For almost nine years, we’ve been the team behind FrontlineSMS, the world’s most-used text messaging platform. Our users have monitored elections, managed clinics, gathered research data, But as we’ve worked with organizations all over the world, in every sector of social change work, we’ve learned that getting the technology up and running is just ten percent of the problem - the real challenges are human, organisational, financial, and ethical. <a class="pink" href="/simlabrefresh/blog/2014/09/02/welcome-to-SIMLab">...</a></p>
