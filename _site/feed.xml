        <title>Our brown bag lunch and podcast: Mobile money in the last mile</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The discussion is available for download as a podcast &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/simlab-podcast/id1056814879?mt=2&quot;&gt;via iTunes&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://soundcloud.com/socialimpactlab/only-tough-options-1&quot;&gt; Soundcloud&lt;/a&gt; , and we expect the insights gained will be valuable for the international development and tech community for practitioners and beyond. Releasing the event as a podcast is an experiment in providing resources for the community that live on beyond the work itself—let us know what you think in the comments!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;mobile-money-in-rural-low-infrastructure-communities&quot;&gt;Mobile money in rural, low infrastructure communities&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/simlabrefresh/images/post_images/sacco.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;sacco&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The event marked the release publication of our case study titled:&lt;a href=&quot;/files/SIMLab Case Study - Mobile money in the last mile.pdf&quot;&gt;SIMLab’s experience in Kenya: Implementing a mobile money management tool and training approach in the last mile&lt;/a&gt; It covers the first direct technology implementation project ever carried out by SIMLab’s first ever direct project implementation, and it and the project were funded by the Global Poverty Action Fund of the UK Department for International Development. SIMLab ordinarily supports other organizations to use inclusive technology in their work, and usually works with local partners together with other actors from the international community. For this project, we built on our presence in Nairobi to work directly with Kenyan organizations, and had the opportunity therefore to gather learning and data. Needless to say, there were numerous lessons learned throughout the two-year grant, which comes to an end in December 2015.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The anticipated outcome of the DFID project is to reduce poverty in low-income areas of Kenya by providing mobile money management tools to organizations and small to medium-sized businesses (SMEs) who had not yet taken up mobile money. At the outset, the grant was inspired by our desire to build better ‘middleware’ to support these types of organizations to begin using mobile money, based on FrontlineSMS, and called ‘Payments.’ During the course of the grant, our relationship to the software shifted slightly as SIMLab spun out FrontlineSMS as a for profit. This allowed our definition of success to broaden from being product-centric to process- and learning-focused, and we were able to support more mobile money platforms including those provided by the operator, Safaricom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The DFID GPAF project was extremely valuable to SIMLab as it allowed us to interface directly with the tools we and FrontlineSMS created, and more importantly the tool users (organizations) and the people the tool was meant to affect. The relationship gave us the opportunity to gain a deep insight into the realities and unique contexts of last-mile organizations as we guided them through the process of adopting mobile money. Through this high-touch work, which included organizational development and strategy, communications, and technology training, we observed the barriers encountered by organizations in operationalizing mobile money. We worked with 40 organizations throughout the grant whom we expected to go through similar hurdles, successes and timelines in their journey to becoming cashless. What we found, and reported in our case study, was that the barriers to adoption were far higher than we’d thought, and the requirements of a successful project in terms of support and staff times were similarly large.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-panel&quot;&gt;The Panel&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our findings, while sobering, were much less controversial for the other panelists than we’d imagined. Overall, we agree that even in a country where 90% of households have access to mobile money, introducing mobile money into businesses and operationalizing it, as Leo Tobias rightly argues, is “terribly complicated.” This narrative is typically overpowered in much of the writing about mobile money, by the one which casts Kenya as a mobile digital economy, the ‘Silicon Savannah’, and a country where physical cash is something of the past. The success stories we read in news articles and international development blog posts accurately describe the prevalence of mobile money, but the use cases they discuss are often derived from the ‘low hanging fruit’—the urban middle class, where mobile money is indeed common, convenient and accessible. What our case study uncovers is the story that’s less often told: that of the struggle, the vast amount of human interaction, motivation and problem-solving required to get mobile money adopted in so-called ‘last-mile’ communities—places where infrastructure, technical capacity and the agent network are weak.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;essential-learnings&quot;&gt;Essential learnings&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;this-work-is-high-touch&quot;&gt;This work is high-touch&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the panel, both Grameen and SIMLab described the vast amount of training and hands-on work that is required to integrate mobile money systems with everyday operations in last-mile organizations. We have seen that the outcome of simply supplying software platforms with little support tends to be misuse, confusion and ultimately a failure to shift systems and sustainably implement new technologies. However, the organizational development work needed to break down barriers to adoption is unfashionable, and contradicts the popular view (and desire) which sees technology innovation as low-cost and exponentially scalable. The organizational development needs of partners are, in our experience, often overlooked and under-budgeted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;people-matter&quot;&gt;People matter&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Motivation, trust, and comfort with change all matter and without tailoring services and training to fulfill the needs of people, adoption will be stifled. SIMLab has had success by identifying and empowering local changemakers who have been able to significantly propel adoption and trust.  A local advocate and peer support network can support organizations and community through change and increase resilience over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;software-is-tough-hardware-is-tough-markets-are-tough&quot;&gt;Software is tough, hardware is tough, markets are tough&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All four panelists spoke to the challenges of the mobile money companies and more broadly, about mobile network operators in frontier markets as being difficult, if not impossible to work with. Sean McDonald described Frontline’s long-term mode of engagement, helping organizations to avoid working directly with mobile network operators (MNOs) by using consumer accounts, effectively, as APIs. The lack of standardization across handset manufacturers and Android operating systems make third-party development an overwhelming challenge here, which likely has an effect on the low number of value-added services (VAS) in the mobile money space, limiting competition to the detriment of users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;shifting-funding-responsibilities&quot;&gt;Shifting funding responsibilities&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kay McGowan responded to the question of what can be done to translate success stories of the urban middle class to the last mile, Kay argues that greater support by the public sector is what the last mile needs. Where economic incentive is lacking for MNOs, for example in developing APIs and pushing agent networks out to the last mile, the public sector has a responsibility to step in, to provide the infrastructure, regulations and governance that would stimulate the business lines that have become infrastructure. All panelists echoed Sean’s statement that underserved areas need to be disproportionately supported in the high-touch interventions they require for successful adoption, but that costs money, time and largely, a realization from donors that it’s a priority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;we-just-arent-there-yet-but-its-where-were-heading&quot;&gt;We just aren’t there yet, but it’s where we’re heading&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Success stories in tough areas are few and far between, but they are possible and we’re quickly learning what it takes to achieve success in challenging contexts. We are building up the experience and knowledge required to make this type of work more reasonable and effective. We as a sector need to continue to state the problems clearly and voice our disenchantment with the status quo. To those of us on the ground, it may seem like we’re still far from winning—but compared to five years ago we’ve made considerable progress. Success stories in urban areas were front page stories, now they’re commonplace; progress is happening, but it happens in pockets and in waves, and we must continue to demand that funding and time go to vulnerable communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-future&quot;&gt;The future?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For us at SIMLab, the Brown Bag Lunch affirmed our approach and conviction that the last mile needs special treatment—and was a fantastic opportunity to share our experiences with the larger development community.  It was reassuring to see we are not the only ones experiencing difficulties in last mile change management, and that these problems are very much on the minds of international organizations many of us in the space. The insights gained on the type of work the development sector needs to push forward in order for us to reach a point where appropriate solutions are available in challenging contexts were promising and seemed tangible.  There are ambitious goals on the horizon of the international development community: the World Bank is aiming at universal financial access by 2020, and to reach this goal international development agencies and development banks are going to have to pay a disproportionate amount of attention to building infrastructure, regulatory conditions and governance in underdeveloped geographies and markets.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Thoughts on our ethos for FrontlineSMS&#39; tenth birthday</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Happy Halloween!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 31st October isn’t just your annual opportunity to eat your weight in sweets - it’s also the official birthday of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.frontlinesms.com&quot;&gt;FrontlineSMS&lt;/a&gt;, and this year marks the tenth anniversary of its first release!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The award-winning SMS management tool was the core of SIMLab’s work for our first seven years - but the first version of the software was actually released for the first time &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.frontlinesms.com/2011/10/31/back-to-the-future-17-things-you-might-not-know-about-frontlinesms/&quot;&gt;on this day in 2005&lt;/a&gt;. In 2007, Ken Banks, our founder, registered what became Social Impact Lab with the US Internal Revenue Service, as the institutional home to receive the foundation funding that he had raised to build a new website and version 1 of the software. In 2014, we &lt;a href=&quot;http://simlab.org/blog/2014/09/02/welcome-to-SIMLab/&quot;&gt;spun out FrontlineSMS as a new for-profit&lt;/a&gt;, and today they release &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.frontlinesms.com/2015/10/30/the-big-1-o/&quot;&gt;two new tools, focussed on campaigns and emergency reporting&lt;/a&gt;, capping off an amazing first year as a company and celebrating their entry into double digits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I joined FrontlineSMS in 2010, Ken honoured me and the other staff with a dizzying amount of trust and confidence. He allowed us to embark on an ambitious redesign of the software just weeks after Sean and I started to lead our operations; gave us responsibility for raising funds and developing a new business model; and trusted us from the beginning to represent the organization and the FrontlineSMS ethos at events and with partners. He calls it his ‘&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.frontlinesms.com/2012/05/29/a-transition-announcement-from-our-founder-ken-banks/&quot;&gt;Rolling Stones School of Management&lt;/a&gt;’, and the opportunity it afforded me changed the course of my career.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the only non-negotiable requirement he had of us all was that we strive every day to fulfill the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.frontlinesms.com/2011/10/17/six-years-on-reinforcing-our-core-values/&quot;&gt;core values&lt;/a&gt; that had informed the FrontlineSMS project from the beginning:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Putting users ahead – and at the heart – of everything we do, striving for a positive interaction with anyone who comes into contact with our work, aiming to inspire others whilst respecting a diversity of views, always reaching for better, fostering a positive “anything is possible” attitude, making sure we continue to put people – and their needs – ahead of the aspirations of the tech community, managing expectations both internally and for our users, and finally – constantly reminding ourselves why we do what we do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘Focus on the users and all else will follow’ was one of the core mantras that I took from my time working directly with Ken. Every day until some time in 2013, I (or &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Flo_Sci&quot;&gt;Florence&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=&quot;https://about.me/silakisoso&quot;&gt;Sila&lt;/a&gt;, or Ken himself) would log into our Ning support site, Twitter and Facebook before we checked our email, and the rule was that all support requests got a reply within 24 hours, except at weekends. FrontlineSMS is still notable for its &lt;a href=&quot;https://frontlinecloud.zendesk.com/home&quot;&gt;excellent user support&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the past year at SIMLab, it’s been very clear to me how core those values still are to our organization. Instead of being embodied in a software platform, they come through in the projects we take on, the work we put into them, our critiques and conversations; the writing and guides we share, and the commitment of our team, so evident to me every day. Indeed, those values were at the heart of the decision to spin out FrontlineSMS - we felt we could better serve both the users of the software and the partners we worked with if we divided our software development team and our growing consulting and policy practice. At the moment we’re working on a clear written set of principles that will guide our work, which we’ll share on our website along with our strategy for the next three years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this weekend, though, we can look back at ten years of supporting FrontlineSMS users to monitor elections, manage rural health clinics, report environmental damage, safeguard humanitarian teams, and thousands of other use cases in more than 130 countries. And we’ll be raising a glass of something pink to FrontlineSMS and its stellar team!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Learn to use mobile in your work through our online course</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update! We’ve extended the deadline to apply to this Sunday, 4 October. Don’t delay and apply for our course today!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are excited to invite you to submit an application for Social Impact Lab’s upcoming online course, “Scalable, Low-Cost Technologies for Civil Society Organizations”, which will run from 06 October- 24 November 2015. You can apply &lt;a href=&quot;http://courses.simlab.org/sign-up/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the third time we’ve run the course, and we have some exciting new features and adjustments, including expanding our language resources and better optimizing the time and formats for low-bandwidth users and working professionals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;what-is-the-course-about&quot;&gt;What is the course about?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The course will guide participants through the use of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.frontlinesms.com/technologies/frontlinesms-overview/&quot;&gt;FrontlineSMS&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.frontlinesms.com/technologies/frontlinecloud-overview/&quot;&gt;FrontlineCloud&lt;/a&gt;.  Modules focus on using the SMS-based two-way communication platform in your programs, and participants will be directly supported to build a project portfolio of their own submitted work based on course assignments, in around 2-3 hours per week. Other topics include how to design mobile-centered or mobile-enabled projects, risk-mapping, data integrity and ethics considerations when using ICTs and mobile phones in civil society, democracy, transparency, and accountability initiatives. The course is made possible by a grant from the United Nations Democracy Fund.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;who-is-this-course-for&quot;&gt;Who is this course for?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The course is designed for people at small and medium organizations, primarily non-profits and NGOs focused on democracy, civic engagement, transparency and accountability. We’ve done our best to optimize the course for low-bandwidth users. However, you will need internet connectivity in order to participate in the course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have begun to translate some of the course resources into French! If you have French colleagues who are interested in participating in a group with you, or in watching the technical demos and completing a few resources for the course, please feel free to share with them. We are currently in the process of doing the same for Spanish, and hope to have these available soon as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;what-is-the-commitment&quot;&gt;What is the commitment?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants will spend about 2-3 hours each week engaging with the platform and materials, with optional online clinic hours offered twice a week for people who want to ask questions in real-time. The course will run for 7 weeks from 06 October- 24 November 2015. The first two modules run for two weeks, since it will take more time to set you up on the software than it will to teach you about new features once you get going. This also allows you to more easily integrate it into your work schedule!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To encourage participation and help cover some of the costs of the course, we’re charging a nominal fee of $50, payable through Paypal (or alternate means if this is not possible for you).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;how-do-i-apply&quot;&gt;How do I apply?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fill out our &lt;a href=&quot;http://courses.frontlinesms.com/sign-up/&quot;&gt;registration form&lt;/a&gt; by 4 October. We’ll accept 35-40 participants and will let you know the status of your application on a rolling basis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;course-fee&quot;&gt;Course Fee&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If accepted, you will be sent instructions to pay your course fee of $50.00.  Please don’t let cost be an inhibiting factor! We have scholarships available by request, please email &lt;a href=&quot;&amp;#109;&amp;#097;&amp;#105;&amp;#108;&amp;#116;&amp;#111;:&amp;#099;&amp;#111;&amp;#117;&amp;#114;&amp;#115;&amp;#101;&amp;#115;&amp;#064;&amp;#115;&amp;#105;&amp;#109;&amp;#108;&amp;#097;&amp;#098;&amp;#046;&amp;#111;&amp;#114;&amp;#103;&quot;&gt;&amp;#099;&amp;#111;&amp;#117;&amp;#114;&amp;#115;&amp;#101;&amp;#115;&amp;#064;&amp;#115;&amp;#105;&amp;#109;&amp;#108;&amp;#097;&amp;#098;&amp;#046;&amp;#111;&amp;#114;&amp;#103;&lt;/a&gt; for more details, or request one in your registration form &lt;a href=&quot;http://courses.frontlinesms.com/sign-up/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;what-if-i-have-other-questions&quot;&gt;What if I have other questions?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can read about the course in more depth &lt;a href=&quot;http://courses.simlab.org/how-it-works/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. If you have any additional questions, send us an email at &lt;a href=&quot;&amp;#109;&amp;#097;&amp;#105;&amp;#108;&amp;#116;&amp;#111;:&amp;#099;&amp;#111;&amp;#117;&amp;#114;&amp;#115;&amp;#101;&amp;#115;&amp;#064;&amp;#115;&amp;#105;&amp;#109;&amp;#108;&amp;#097;&amp;#098;&amp;#046;&amp;#111;&amp;#114;&amp;#103;&quot;&gt;&amp;#099;&amp;#111;&amp;#117;&amp;#114;&amp;#115;&amp;#101;&amp;#115;&amp;#064;&amp;#115;&amp;#105;&amp;#109;&amp;#108;&amp;#097;&amp;#098;&amp;#046;&amp;#111;&amp;#114;&amp;#103;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Can SMS be used to reach women and girls in new ways in emergencies?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Humanitarian agencies have made increasing use of SMS and mobile telephony in disaster response since the South Asian Tsunami in 2004-5, but particularly following the Haitian earthquake in 2010, where lack of access to communities and high mobile penetration combined to make SMS an attractive means of distributing key messages about sanitation and available assistance. From the last mile rural community to the most vulnerable in urban settings, the predictable cost, asynchronous but intimate nature, and inherent robustness of SMS make it ideal for moving small packets of information swiftly and reliably. In contexts where communication by other means is costly or unreliable, SMS can be effectively used to manage staff and volunteers, collect management information and monitoring data, and provide a responsive two-way communications channel for beneficiaries and communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given its potential, can SMS be used to reach women and girls in new ways in emergencies? At present, this is only partially clear—as with much of the existing knowledge about the impact of SMS and mobile in disaster relief, more robust data is required before we understand precisely how this works. In many cases, the nature of women’s interaction with technology makes this difficult to acquire. It’s hard to make basic statements about women’s use of technology in the developing world with great confidence. Women are less likely than men to have the paperwork required to register a SIM card, so their phone may be registered, if not owned and controlled by their male relatives. Women may not have unfettered or unobserved access to handsets, which indeed can be used as instruments of control. For adolescent girls, age is an additional barrier which may make it doubly difficult for them to make use of mobile programs designed to empower them. However, it’s clear that there are potential gains for women and girls in providing mobile access channels to services such as healthcare and nutrition information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In post-Tsunami Batticaloa, Sri Lanka, Minmini News set up an SMS news service for women that attempted to reflect the concerns and experiences of women not covered in the mainstream media. News was sourced, produced and shared by women, for women, to overwhelmingly positive reviews from its users. News information on public services, local emergencies, and women’s experiences, achievements and challenges was collected, fact-checked and written up in text messages by a central ‘news team’ of one or two women and reviewed by an editor. This information was sent out using FrontlineSMS as one to three messages each day. Women who received the messages said that the service had changed their relationship to news and information, and mitigated some of the social challenges women experienced in getting and sharing news through normal channels. One woman, displaced and maltreated, was found and brought home as a direct result of information shared via the service. Minmini News has not yet reported its longer-term impacts, and no age-disaggregated data was collected, so there is no way to understand whether the particular needs and concerns of adolescent girls were met through the initiative. However, examples like Yoza, a South African mLiteracy project, show the potential power of engaging young people, including girls, through mobile-based interventions, even in resource-constrained contexts like urban slums.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like any other communications platform, effective use of SMS requires careful context assessment and an understanding of if and how SMS is routinely used by a population. Where SMS use is inhibited by cultural and technical factors, as in southern Pakistan, it is far better to use communications tools that already work for the community. In the 2010 southern Pakistan floods, aid agencies fresh from the Haiti response and remembering the successful use of SMS in the NWFP (North-West Frontier Province) in Pakistan’s 2008 post-conflict displacement were surprised to note almost no use of SMS by the local population. This was due to low literacy levels, and also because the local dialect was written in a script whose character set wasn’t present on most cellphones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Understanding all this through a gendered, age-sensitive lens requires closer, more qualitative analysis. What is clear, is that women will experience all the same barriers to mobile phone access and using SMS as men, but often to a greater degree, and in some cases, young women and girls most of all. Literacy is an obvious limiting factor for SMS use—and women and girls are less likely to be literate than men and boys—although proximate literacy (where the recipient takes the SMS to someone who reads to understand the message), functional literacy (where the recipient can successfully interpret a familiar message, such as a mobile money notification) and the run-and-tell model, where one literate member of a community receives a message and spreads the word, are all able to circumvent this challenge to a degree. Disability and infirmity may make SMS hard to read and access, so they may not be appropriate for older people, who may be less aware of or less likely to adopt new technologies. Lack of access to handsets and electricity may inhibit cellphone use altogether, and women are less likely to own and control their own phone than men. Access to power is a major financial and infrastructural challenge. Women’s incomes are lower and in some areas people spend as much money on powering their phones as on airtime. In a crisis, this disposable income is the first thing to go, coupled with the fact that access to power if communities are displaced is not a given. Travel, which is often required to get a signal or electricity to charge handsets in rural areas, is more difficult for women and girls. Finally, cultural factors may inhibit SMS use. Gender roles may mean that such a link to the public world, or owning and controlling technology in this way, is not considered appropriate or necessary for women. This is particularly challenging for girls, where elders may have concerns around the sexualisation, or sometimes the Westernization, of young women exposed to information via the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Agencies need to carefully consider the opportunities and challenges inherent in using mobile for women in emergencies. It seems that while there may be initial hurdles to overcome, once women are able to make the case for access to technology and learn how to best use it for their advantage, the potential is enormous for their opportunistic use of information to improve their lives and those of their families. Agencies will still need to avoid pitfalls—messages relating to family planning or access to cash grants need careful consideration in the same way that analogue delivery would, and we cannot make assumptions about the degree of privacy women and girls have on their handsets. Considering young women, for whom both age and gender may act as barriers to access to technology and information, requires an additional depth of enquiry into social behavior and cultural norms that may be only partly articulated and understood. But in this context, a more long-term, community-oriented approach, where SMS is used as an easy interaction channel to foster community ownership of programs and open feedback about the work, may allay fear and suspicion and help women to improve the resilience of their entire community to disaster, through mobile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This case study describes the midterm progress and learning from a two-year project, funded by the UK Government’s Department for International Development (DFID). The project introduced a new mobile money management software to forty ‘last-mile’ organizations, all of which faced significant infrastructure, access and capacity constraints making the transition to cashless processes cumbersome and unpredictable. This case study seeks to shed light on the challenges of extending mobile money to the last mile, through a human and organization-centric lens. Although the project operated only in Kenya, but with the learning is applicable globally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;about-simlab&quot;&gt;About SIMLab&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Social Impact Lab (SIMLab) helps people and organizations to use inclusive technologies to build systems and services that are accessible, responsive, and resilient. Until December 2014, SIMLab was the home of the FrontlineSMS project, a suite of software that helps organizations build services with text messages. FrontlineSMS has now spun out as a separate, for-profit social enterprise, and SIMLab continues to focus on solving many of the challenges of implementing projects using inclusive technologies. They support implementation, the sharing of learning and synthesis of best practice, and advocate to decision-makers and donors for policy-level change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SIMLab defines inclusive technologies as those which embody values critical to truly scalable, locally-owned impact; accessibility, ease of use, interoperability, and sustainability. Mobile is a key example—SMS and voice telephony reach all of the world’s 3.6 billion mobile subscribers—as is radio, a critical technology for broad reach at relatively low cost. We also embrace both ends of the spectrum of inclusive tech—the increasing availability and affordability of cheap web-enabled phones and mobile data make them more accessible for relatively disconnected communities, and more analogue communications technologies, such as public criers, noticeboards and human networks, like religious structures and community leadership, reach into even the most remote and disconnected communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SIMLab’s Last Mile Mobile Money Project helps small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and under-resourced organizations explore available tools to realize the latent potential in mobile value transfer technologies for social change. SIMLab helped partners to break down barriers to innovation; both internally, through change management and business process consulting, and externally, through trainings on how to engage with and educate end-users to begin using accessible mobile money technologies. Through this project, SIMLab has been able to help organizations realize the uses and limitations of inclusive technologies and mobile money, while better understanding the types of organizational characteristics necessary in the implementation of digitization and cashless systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;unbanked-in-kenya-providing-financial-services-in-the-worlds-most-mobile-first-economy&quot;&gt;‘Unbanked’ in Kenya: providing financial services in the world’s most mobile-first economy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 2014 annual report of the Africa Progress Panel (APP), a group headed by Kofi Annan, highlighted economic development as one of three major areas where progress was needed. For wealthier communities, financial inclusion is fairly easy—transferring, saving, and managing money are just an ATM or app away. For last-mile and low-income communities, these processes are not only far away, they’re often impossibly complex and exclusionary. Poor physical infrastructure (roads, electricity), security risks, and lack of financial capital all prohibit those in last-mile communities from accessing global and regional markets, value chains, and financial services. These barriers preclude rural, poor, and other marginalized populations from accessing resources that could facilitate economic development—from starting their own businesses, accessing markets, insuring their crops, and planning for their future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These populations, often referred to as ‘unbanked’ for their lack of access to formal bank accounts, and the small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and NGOs that serve them are impacted in very practical ways. For example, to access services or transmit funds, people may have to travel long distances while carrying large sums of cash, incurring heavy transportation costs and leaving them vulnerable to personal security risks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While approximately 2.5 billion people in developing countries worldwide are classified as ‘unbanked,’ more than 1 billion of them have access to a mobile phone, through which people in over 89 countries (60% of the developing world)&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; can now access mobile money services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2007, Kenya’s leading mobile network operator, Safaricom, created the world’s most successful mobile money platform to date, Kenya’s M-PESA. M-PESA currently has over 19 million users, and is globally lauded as a disruptive and pioneering innovation, which has changed the financial landscape, not only in Kenya, but all over the world, as similar services spring up elsewhere. In Tanzania, Uganda, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Afghanistan, the Philippines and South Africa, mobile money uptake is increasing, although no other market yet matches Kenya for mobile money adoption.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Bill payment services by large businesses are increasingly common, and M-PESA users last year sent 11 billion Kenya Shillings per month through the service.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:3&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:3&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; For peer-to-peer (P2P) transactions such as urban to rural remittances, M-PESA has been transformative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-challenges&quot;&gt;The challenges&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the majority of businesses in Kenya, however, M-PESA seems still to be out of reach, although during the period of SIMLab’s project, Safaricom has launched numerous products trying to gain traction in this market. PayBill, Lipa Na M-PESA, Lipa Na Karo and M-Shwari each target different transaction types: savings accounts and payments made to businesses that are connected with a bank account, over the counter transactions, school fees, and short term micro-mobile loans respectively. These platforms are typically relatively expensive for the company to get set up on and use, require a reliable internet connection to use successfully and can take months to acquire. Some require training, and none are designed with the last-mile user in mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SIMLab, with support from The UK Department for International Development (DFID)’s Global Poverty Action Fund (GPAF), set out to explore whether providing a new type of platform to organizations like this could help them to implement mobile money, and in so doing, could improve economic livelihoods in rural Kenya. Our theory of change, essentially, was that mobile money could be a transformative tool for rural schools, NGOs, SMEs and Savings and Cooperative Credit Organizations (SACCOs), but that the lack of affordable offline management platforms was having a chilling effect. With a better platform and hands-on support to get started, organizations would be able to begin using mobile money and their end-users—parents and children, beneficiaries, customers and borrowers—would gain all the benefits of mobile money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even in Kenya, the mobile value transfer market is still new, and as such the market and ecosystem is still spreading and is often inefficient and uneven in coverage. In the most rural populations, many people do not use M-PESA, or only use it to receive remittances from other parts of Kenya, and immediately exchange their balance for cash. Part of the reason for this is low availability of mobile payments for goods in these areas. An important goal of the project was to test the value of mobile money in a variety of sectors and types of organizations, both to learn, and as an advocacy tool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a two-year project beginning in January of 2014, the project has supported 40 rural organizations to implement two pieces of software designed and built by FrontlineSMS in Nairobi, Kenya as part of the FrontlineSMS suite of tools. This case study examines the progress and challenges experienced in the first year and a half of the project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-software-prototypes-paymentview-and-payments&quot;&gt;The software prototypes: PaymentView and Payments&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project began with an existing prototype. PaymentView, built in 2011-2012 with funding from an award won in the Vodafone Americas Wireless Challenge, and intended to fill the gap between Safaricom’s M-PESA mobile money system, and the SMEs who could benefit from using mobile money at an enterprise level. At the idea’s inception, M-PESA offered only the customer-facing USSD and SIM toolkit tools, and an online corporate interface, which was expensive to get set up for and difficult to use, and had relatively limited functionality. Early interviewees in financial services organizations and SMEs confirmed that they were using simple phones to manage transactions, often losing data and unable to easily do basic accounting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/simlabrefresh/images/dfidcase/Picture2.png&quot; alt=&quot;PaymentView Interface&quot; /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Screenshot of PaymentView interface&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PaymentView was based on version 1 of FrontlineSMS, which was released in 2008 and superseded in 2012 by version 2. When building any new tool, it’s important to have your intended user in mind and to know their capabilities and needs, as well as the infrastructure and context in which they’re operating. This user persona can guide software design and development. 10 partners began testing PaymentView in the first year of the project, and the insights we gained were incorporated into the design and features of a new platform, Payments. The key user persona created for Payments was an administrator of one of our target organizations, using a low-end laptop or desktop computer, who does not have stable access to internet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The decision to begin the project with the older piece of software benefited the design of the eventual product, Payments—but at the cost of some frustration and eagerness to experiment for some of our pilot partners. Although functional, Paymentview proved unreliable, and as it was outdated, was not supported by the FrontlineSMS team. Bugs in PaymentView had resulted in a loss of financial data, delays in processing of transactions, and inability to determine whether payments had been sent, failed or were still being processed. As others have found, innovations must work fully and efficiently in order to maintain a consistent level of engagement with partner organizations.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:4&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:4&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; If there are any difficulties in the process, implementers quickly lose focus and refuse to use the less reliable parts of the software, as has been the experience with PaymentView. The state of the software caused some frustration in some of the partner organizations who were either trying to use non-functioning elements of the software or who exceeded its in- or outgoing payment limits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;key-takeaways&quot;&gt;Key Takeaways&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Certain types of organizations can test prototype software in current development for up to six months, so long as it significantly improves a business process. That time is helpful to allow organizations to change their working practices and end-user communication, and provides an opportunity for technology partners to gather feedback about usability and features. However, continuing beyond six months, risks partner fatigue with the challenges of using an unfinished product. Some partners had high expectations of both PaymentView and Payments, and reverted to their previous systems when the software failed to meet them. In some cases, this was an organization-wide decision, but more commonly, it was a decision made by the person interacting with the software on a daily basis.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hardware requirements must be communicated prior to trainings to ensure all internal approvals are taken care of. When working with rural project staff it is very easy for them to be quickly discouraged by any processes requiring steps outside of their day-to-day obligations. If SIMLab staff left the training without having completed all set-up steps, such as acquisition of a business SIM card and modem, then it was observed that the project was far less likely to go forward.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The software can require a steep learning curve, especially for a user with low computer literacy. Due to the time it takes to ‘master’ the software, some users may lose motivation and simply quit. It is not clear how to resolve this challenge, but the high-touch demands of our project suggest that highly scalable approaches to rolling out mobile money in rural, low-infrastructure, low-resource organizations may need to factor in resource-intensive hands-on support, or very high usability.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In early 2015, Payments replaced PaymentView and joined a robust and frequently-updated Frontline product set. The software, currently in private beta, has the same core features of PaymentView but benefits from the greater usability, capacity and backend logic of FrontlineSMS v2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/simlabrefresh/images/dfidcase/Picture3.png&quot; alt=&quot;Payments Interface&quot; /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Screenshot of Payments Interface&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Payments builds on the FrontlineSMS software’s improved browser-based navigation and adds dynamic financial management automation, allowing organizations to track and manage an entire lifecycle of payments. The logic built into the software allows users to clearly visualize payment histories at both a contact and aggregate level, making it an effective tool for payment reconciliation and monitoring. Payments gives organizations an in-depth look into a client’s entire mobile financial history and also aggregates groups of clients by status of loans (active, default or completed). Additionally, Payments allows organizations to easily and safely send out payments to large groups of beneficiaries—which can drastically cut down on administration time and costs. Payments supports all Safaricom products, including M-PESA’s PayBill and Lipa na M-PESA accounts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, some partners wholeheartedly embraced all other elements of the project, but for various reasons did not elect to roll out Payments or PaymentView. At time of writing, partners are being assessed for the appropriate level and focus of support in the final six months of the project. Our follow-up case study in 2016 will include more detail on the evolution of this aspect of our support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-hardware&quot;&gt;The hardware&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the major improvements implemented with Payments was the move away from modems to Android phones as the hardware ‘gateway’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of our major problems throughout the project has been in finding and making available hardware work for our purposes. Producing a generic platform for global, multi-sector use that leverages commonly-available technology necessarily has to solve problems of widely varying hardware, unpredictable sourcing, and fragmented smartphone operating systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the time PaymentView was built, modems were a relatively easy hardware to obtain and work with and were the most familiar hardware to the FrontlineSMS development team. However, since the development of the platform, the market of tools available has diversified and modems—ubiquitous in 2012 as the best way to get your laptop online without wifi—are being eclipsed by smartphones. Simple Huawei e-Series modems are still available in most urban shopping districts, but the more sophisticated and expensive Sierra Wireless modems, always hard to source, are now almost impossible to buy wholesale. Modems are also a less attractive purchase for partners, as the modem can only be used to run the software, rendering them single-use items. To overcome this, Payments was designed to connect using a locally-available Android phone, which allows organizations to send and receive payments as well as missed calls, and can double as an office mobile phone, proving helpful for small, low-budget organizations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Payments, and the Frontline product set more broadly, are useful to partners because they surpass and circumvent the B-to-C offerings of mobile networks and allow users to bypass relationships with operators altogether, by allowing them to run business processes on readily available private accounts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a challenge inherent in working this way, however. These approaches require the user to utilize consumer hardware in ways unintended by the manufacturer, in markets where available phones can vary wildly. In Kenya, for example, a flood of unpredictable Chinese smartphones jostle with second-hand and new Android and iOS smartphones, modems and feature- and ‘dumb phones’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Operating at the intersection of hardware, software and unpredictable externalities like mobile connectivity and viruses, the prototypes we were testing could sometimes fail, with many potential points of failure:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hardware&lt;/strong&gt;: Android phones (used to accept payments and send and receive SMS—only Samsung phones successfully sent out payments); Safaricom modems; USB cables and ports; computers and laptops of various makes, models and operating systems; Safaricom SIM cards of various types (personal without M-PESA, personal with M-PESA, Pay Bill, Lipa na M-PESA); and wifi routers.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Software&lt;/strong&gt;: computer operating systems; firewall and anti-virus software; software installers; device installers and drivers; and different versions of FrontlineSMS and Payments&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sheer number of things that can go wrong, interact differently than expected, or simply not work makes troubleshooting and getting organizations set up remotely a very daunting task.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For larger-scale projects to work effectively and avoid these problems altogether, there is no alternative but to work through the solutions offered by the business-facing market—and deal with their inherent limitations of process, cost and functionality. Given the limited nature of even the recently-released M-PESA API, it is clear that the market has yet to produce a truly scalable and effective solution for SMEs in Kenya.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;support&quot;&gt;Support&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SIMLab offers phone, Skype, email and on the ground support to the organizations with which we work. Partner organizations can run into difficulties with mobile network operators, office computers, mobile money agents and with the software and hardware we provide; so SIMLab resolve the problem either through our own solution or through connecting the organization with someone who can. Depending on the type of support requested, we work with the organization to determine a plan of action and ensure that our suggested solutions truly solve the problem. The FrontlineSMS developer team allocates a few hours a month to fixing bugs on the Payments software, which they will support until the end of the grant period. Occasionally partner organizations may come across a bug in the software, and when this happens, the partner either emails the bug details to SIMLab to pass on to FrontlineSMS, or the bug is described over the phone in detail and transcribed into a support ticket for the FrontlineSMS team to handle. Part of the training with partner organizations covers support and technical troubleshooting, where SIMLab shows partner organizations how to take screen shots, and download Payments system logs, both of which are critical to ensuring the bug is accurately understood and fixed. At the conclusion of the project, partners will have to handle accessing this support themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;people-and-organization-change-management-and-capacity-development&quot;&gt;People and organization change management and capacity development&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By far the largest challenge was to develop a recipe for transitioning different types of partners from cash to mobile payments. This required us to understand an organization’s operational and programmatic processes, and how existing processes could be adapted to encourage beneficiaries and clients to transition to using mobile payments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trainings with partner organizations initially consisted of one- to two-day on-site sessions with critical members of staff usually including finance staff, project staff and a member of senior management. Trainings aimed to dive deeply into the organization’s programs and operations, come to a consensus about where mobile money should be piloted, set out roles and responsibilities in the roll out of mobile money and provide an orientation to the Payments or PaymentView software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;shifting-to-a-change-management-approach&quot;&gt;Shifting to a change management approach&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, follow-up calls and emails after the first few trainings indicated that organizations were struggling with the change management and client education that shifting from analogue to digital required. This was especially evident in organizations that received incoming payments from clients, as opposed to simply sending out payments. Organizations were being asked to answer questions about how their clients would benefit from using M-PESA instead of cash, how clients would know that their payments were successfully received, and what happened if they were to accidentally send a payment to the wrong number.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SIMLab began working with partners to develop incentives for their clients to shift to mobile money and strategies for how to explain the change to their clients. We increased the frequency of contact with partners, focusing heavily on effectively communicating value propositions to all beneficiaries and stakeholders. To ensure that implementing mobile money is not held up by staff turnover or underperformance of one employee, numerous individuals from each organization were involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;focus-on-the-end-user&quot;&gt;Focus on the end-user&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SIMLab’s new training methodology integrates approaches to client communication and sensitization, tailored to NGOs and SACCOs based on their differing needs and effectively communicating the different value propositions. These strategies help partner organizations explain the benefits of mobile money to their clients and members, as well as to their internal staff. For example, we would stress to SACCO staff that their members would see lower levels of fraud, more secure transactions, a reduction in travel costs and time, improved access to information on loan and savings status, improved communication with SACCO administrators, and could send out quick and easy reminders for meetings and loan repayments. Likewise, with NGOs, we would predict a decrease in time and costs spent documenting and delivering payments, a simplification of payroll and other recurring payments, improved financial management and cash flow visibility, the ability to visualize and easily send financial reports to external stakeholders or board members, and improved contact management (clients/service providers and staff). SIMLab also offered partner organizations a number of client awareness-raising resources they can adjust for their own organization, including draft SMS, flyers, and announcements to be read at meetings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;key-takeaway&quot;&gt;Key Takeaway&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Partners themselves need to be reminded that change requires time and effort. Initial expectations on the part of the partner organizations were too high in terms of their own capacity to make drastic change. With any innovation, an organization needs to take time to experiment and understand the implications of the innovation on all stakeholders, including executives and management, administrators, program staff, beneficiaries and end users.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;building-networks-for-peer-support-and-learning&quot;&gt;Building networks for peer support and learning&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initially, SIMLab trained organizations one by one, but ultimately began running trainings for multiple organizations at a time. This allowed us more time overall with key staff members, and created peer support networks that would provide support once we had left the area, and after the project closes. When two or more similar organizations attend the same training, they are able to learn from each other and quickly build up best practices, as well as have a local partner to discuss issues with such as tracking transaction costs. Additionally, finding and identifying individual ‘champions’ has proven invaluable to keep up momentum on the ground, which also helps to take some of the support burden from the SIMLab team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;mobile-money-may-not-be-appropriate-for-all-payments&quot;&gt;Mobile money may not be appropriate for all payments&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of our pilot partners experienced challenges in attempting to implement digital payments where the human element of the transaction is critical given cultural values, habits and the nature of the transaction taking place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One SACCO we worked with tried to transition all loan disbursements and repayments. But loans are sensitive: they are not normal transactions. They can result from death, the loss of a home or of livestock, or illness; or they can reflect positive life events, such as a school loan to advance one’s opportunities, a marriage loan or starting a business. A person taking out a loan has likely come to the decision very carefully, and are willing to spend a bit of time and money to acquire. Except in extreme situations, we’ve found that people would much prefer to visit the office of a trusted financial institution to discuss taking out their loan, and decide together with the administrator a feasible loan repayment schedule. The paper loan agreement is significant, and often copied and taped to the wall of their home to remind themselves of the financial commitment they have made. People want to be physically handed at least part of the loan in cash or check, while sitting next to a person who’s job it is to ensure the total loan amount is received. This is about more than receiving a correct loan amount—it’s about seeking guidance, sympathy and shared excitement about the loan and the event it is tied to, with the staff member of their financial institution. Our partner ultimately reinstated loan disbursements in cash or check, and accepted repayments using mobile money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;key-takeaways-1&quot;&gt;Key Takeaways&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A huge part of the challenge in transitioning to mobile payments is understanding where mobile payments are beneficial in terms of time and cost savings, and where cash or other forms of value transfer are more economical and culturally appropriate. Without knowing how to implement mobile money, organizations aiming to make the shift to digital payments can easily become dissuaded from using mobile money by attempting to transition all payments in the form of mobile money, or by applying it only to a limited part of programs, creating more work to implement than the benefit derived. Technology has its limits—even if the tool is available it doesn’t mean it should be used in all circumstances. Mobile money should not eliminate human interaction; but rather facilitate payments when human interaction is not possible, too expensive and inundating.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For some of our partners, simply the move from less formal handwritten processes to more formal digitized databases had a huge impact. In moving from analogue to digital records, partner organization Sadili formalized their record-keeping process. When they looked at their digitized records, they realized that only 23 of their 127 members had been paying their dues on a monthly basis. Formalizing their processes increased their income, by shielding their staff—all hired from the local area—from pressure from customers to cut them a deal. Mobile payments can help to reduce fraud and improve accountability, just by removing human susceptibility from the equation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once we understood how many variables mattered in assessing probable success and the ability of a partner to make change, we expanded our assessment benchmarks to include users’ computer literacy levels, total staff size, beneficiary type and degree of centralization of financial processes. Nonetheless, some of the organizations we trained did ultimately fail to implement Payments, and are classed as ‘inactive’, specifically because of the barriers to the transition to mobile money: infrastructure constraints, HR capacity, or from fatigue with the process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;schools-just-dont-fit-the-bill&quot;&gt;Schools just don’t fit the bill&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Past success in working with schools meant that schools were included as a target user in the project proposal. However, it appears that schools, being part of a government-run bureaucracy and working on a specific annual cycle, need carefully-timed support and pre-existing internal buy-in that was not possible to achieve on our project timeline. While school is on a break, teachers are also not in school—but pupil payments for tuition (the target of our potential intervention) are made at the very beginning of the term, meaning there is only a very short window of opportunity to introduce the software prior to the day parents would need to begin making mobile payments. Even had they wanted to, school staff required ministry sign-off to make changes to their systems and payment plans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Successful implementation in schools would require government intervention and funding to overcome their barriers to implementation: resistance from staff and parents, bureaucracy, and scheduling and budget challenges. The learning that has come out of this project could, however, lay the groundwork for government-supported transition from cash to mobile, and SIMLab has already proven in the past that a software such as FrontlineSMS with Payments has the requisite functions to effectively manage such an operation in schools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;supporting-our-partners-to-work-with-m-pesa&quot;&gt;Supporting our partners to work with M-PESA&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As M-PESA’s project offerings have broadened, the project has required SIMLab to support partners to determine which product is best fit, registered an account, and get up and running. Ultimately, SIMLab worked directly with M-PESA to facilitate access and acquisition of customer to business (C2B) solutions. M-PESA launched their Paybill service in April of 2009, allowing Kenyans to pay their electricity bills straight from their phone. Its aim is to simplify customer to business payments over the phone, without the need for other direct interaction. Many of SIMLab’s partner organizations fit the profile, but we found that, for multiple reasons, small organizations were not taking advantage of the service. Partners consistently reported difficulties procuring the necessary M-PESA business accounts, including opaque processes, lack of feedback, and no training centers in rural areas. After informal consultations with M-PESA staff members, SIMLab worked with Safaricom M-PESA local offices to support partners, reducing the processing time with Safaricom from over three months to just two weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We see the newer Lipa Na M-PESA product, intended to facilitate over the counter mobile transactions, as a response to these difficulties, which must have been reported by small organizations all over Kenya—the product offers some of the essential features of the Paybill service, such as direct integration with bank accounts, but available with much less time and pain. This developing trend and other successes in the mobile money ecosystem may represent the slow maturation of the mobile money market, as it begins to put greater emphasis on users’ needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;impact&quot;&gt;Impact&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;21 months in, and 6 months after launching Payments, the project has seen large changes in both mobile money and SMS use among participating organizations—but not necessarily tied to the Payments or PaymentView platforms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SIMLab staff have recruited and trained 44 organizations: 32 NGOs, 11 SACCOs and 1 school. Out of the 44 organizations with which SIMLab has worked, 37 of them had never used mobile money within their organizations and to date 31 of the 37 are at minimum using a Safaricom mobile money business product. 100% of the active partners have experimented with SMS communications to and from their clients and beneficiaries and the majority now list SMS as one of the main communication tools used within the organization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Out of the 37 partners who remain a part of the project, 14 are using Payments exclusively; 15 are using Paybill with use of FrontlineSMS for sending SMS; 1 is using PaymentView; 1 is using cash; 3 are using M-PESA on a phone; and 2 are not operational for the time being. Those using Paybill were encouraged by SIMLab to do so before Payments was released, as it offered the best value to the organization and their clients. Some partners would prefer to switch to Payments from Paybill, but have been prevented from doing so by the lengthy process required to transition away from Paybill’s online service to a regular M-PESA account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In most cases partner organizations can point to improved efficiency and cost savings. Prior to using PaymentView, international NGO HealthRight staff physically delivered money to the field, a process that took six hours and placed staff members at risk. Similarly, Mombasa Bunge, Kwale Bunge and Nyamira SACCOs have reduced costs for their members, who no longer need to travel from their homes to the SACCO office to deposit cash for their savings. Nyamira SACCO members reported spending as much as 2,000 Kenyan Shillings for a round-trip from their homes to the bank branch to make loan repayments, reduced now to the 100 shilling transaction costs and transport to an M-PESA agent to load cash onto their mobile wallets. Mombasa SACCO has seen membership numbers increase by 30% since implementing Payments, more members saving and taking loans, and slightly higher repayment rates. The combination of these three improvements have made the Mombasa SACCO more profitable and they are excited to continue using mobile payments and SMS. SIMLab hopes to see more organizations experience significant changes similar to the Mombasa and Nyamira SACCOs in the upcoming months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nyamira, Kisumu and Kisii Bunge SACCOs report increased efficiencies in communicating with their members—sending reminders to save extra money, notifications of financial obligations, and meeting announcements—all of which previously took them a few hours to coordinate over voice calls or SMS using their personal handsets. SACCOs are beginning to see greater monthly saving and meeting participation due to an increase in knowledge of the meetings, associated with SMS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;plans-for-the-future&quot;&gt;Plans for the future&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SIMLab will continue to work throughout 2015 to document the successes of the project, learn from the failures, and motivate organizations to continue engaging with their beneficiaries and clients to explore ways that SMS and mobile payments can increase their opportunities. Project staff will revisit organizations who are not yet fully using Payments and try to migrate them by understanding the barriers holding them back. By the end of the project in December 2015, SIMLab hopes to have resolved any remaining issues partners may have to ensure they’ll be able to continue using Payments and have reliable support on the platform for the foreseeable future. Part of the success of this will depend on ensuring the Payments documentation and user guides are maintained and as detailed and helpful as possible. Another key factor will be to ensure partners are prepared to adapt their operational processes to anticipate change in membership/beneficiaries, group structures and increasing decentralization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FrontlineSMS, the developers and owners of Payments, are currently exploring a potential business model for the software that will make it a viable product after the end of the current project. They are looking into hardware solutions, such as procuring wholesale smartphones direct from the manufacturer, that would be more feasible in Kenya and allow the software to better transfer to other countries with vibrant mobile money markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through the last 20 months, this project has had plenty of challenges but found success, in sometimes unexpected ways, and in unlikely places. SIMLab set out to assess whether, by supporting SMEs and service providers to implement mobile money, they could address the dearth of businesses offering M-PESA payments and increase the utility of mobile money for people in rural, low-infrastructure communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The project has been able to put the highly lauded M-PESA mobile money platform to the test in some of the most difficult and variable contexts in Kenya, engaging with organizations who haven’t yet adopted mobile money despite the existence of business solutions and the strength of the market across the country. SIMLab has created tailored training and engagement approaches to fit varying levels of infrastructure and operational constraints. The project is a strong example of a human-centered approach to mobile money adoption, using agile project management with last-mile organizations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the high-touch approach that was required calls into doubt both the potential of mobile money to scale organically in these communities, and the emphasis we often see on ‘exponentially’ scalable, technology-first approaches within the mobile money space. It may be that the transition from informal to formal, and from analogue to digital business processes, simply requires more support, more time, or both, than many recognize.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Implementers and donors must acknowledge the need for flexible, human-centred project implementation methods which respect local contexts and individual organizations and their business models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As technology advances, and more tailored technology solutions are developed, technologists need to keep in mind the users they’re building for, and who they may be inadvertently excluding. When it comes to including the most vulnerable, hard to reach organizations and beneficiaries, how can we as technologists ensure users understand the tools available to them? Mobile money, even in arguably the world’s most developed mobile money market, is still a huge challenge for organizations to adopt and one which will require collaboration with governments, MNOs, civil society organizations and technology providers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, although stimulating businesses and improving service delivery is an important outcome of this project, it remains to be seen whether the ultimate aim has been achieved: whether an increase in the number of businesses offering mobile money in the communities in which SIMLab worked will lead to an attributable improvement in mobile money liquidity and an increase in individuals in these communities able to access the benefits of mobile money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;annex-partner-profiles&quot;&gt;Annex: Partner Profiles&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SIMLab is working with 33 NGOs, 11 SACCOs and 1 school across Kenya. Below, a few of the partner organizations experiences with Payments are highlighted:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;healthright&quot;&gt;HealthRight&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Size:&lt;/strong&gt; 1000 volunteers, 16 full-time staff&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Area of work:&lt;/strong&gt; Health and capacity building  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Payments Profile:&lt;/strong&gt; In Elgeyo Marakwet, in the North Rift Valley of Kenya, HealthRight runs projects that rely on a dedicated network of 150 volunteers. All administration is conducted from their head office in Kitale, approximately 100 kilometers away from project volunteers. The administrator at HealthRight uses Payments to pay out stipend allowances to their volunteers on the ground. Now that they’re able to send stipends using mobile money instead of physically handing out cash, they have reduced logistical costs and inconveniences, including eliminating a weekly six-hour drive and security threats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;mombasa-youth-bunge-sacco&quot;&gt;Mombasa Youth Bunge SACCO&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Size&lt;/strong&gt;: 440 monthly members, 1 full-time staff  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Area of work:&lt;/strong&gt; microfinance and youth  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Payments Profile:&lt;/strong&gt; Mobile money users in the Mombasa Youth Bunge SACCO have increased by almost 100%, saving members time and expenses incurred while making deposits. The SACCO’s membership numbers have increased from 370 to 440 active monthly members, a substantial increase for a small microfinance organization, attributed to member referrals due to satisfaction with an ease of payments and SMS notifications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mobile payment tracking has become a quick and automated, process, improving SACCO management accountability. As part of the training, SIMLab has also helped the Mombasa Youth Bunge SACCO to acquire a Paybill account, where M-PESA deposits go directly to the SACCO’s bank account, increasing interest rates. This also removes the need for intermediary cash handling, which is prone to fraud and loss, and carries additional expenses incurred from travel to the bank by the SACCO administration staff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;scope-strengthening-community-partnership-and-empowerment&quot;&gt;SCOPE (Strengthening Community Partnership and Empowerment)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Size:&lt;/strong&gt; 1200 beneficiaries, 10 staff members  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Area of work:&lt;/strong&gt; Poverty reduction, education, and health   &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Payments Profile:&lt;/strong&gt; SIMLab’s initial training with SCOPE revealed that their biggest operational challenge was sending and verifying payments. In the past they’ve encountered problems with beneficiaries denying having received payment, staff sending payments to the wrong person, and security. They were initially using Safaricom’s bulk payment system to send monthly payments to approximately 1,200 volunteers, with amounts ranging from 500-1000KSH ($5.46-10.93 USD). However, this system did not offer them the necessary visibility and reliability, primarily because Safaricom’s system requires the internet. SCOPE is now using Payments to send and track all payments. Payments allows them to see all payment details, and include additional notes about the payments, features which are not available through Safaricom. SCOPE is also using the SMS feature of Payments to send health content via SMS to beneficiaries, increasing the effectiveness of health interventions. While Payments is intended to be a mobile money tool, SCOPE has used it to additionally meet their organizational goals by starting a SMS health messaging campaign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;indicose-sacco&quot;&gt;Indicose SACCO&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Size:&lt;/strong&gt; 47 monthly active members, 1 full-time staff  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Area of work:&lt;/strong&gt; microfinance  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Payments Profile:&lt;/strong&gt; SIMLab was referred to Indicose SACCO by an organization in Kisumu who had recently learned that the SACCO was seeking a solution to better manage their payments. The SACCO had recently lost a number of members, greatly impacting their profitability and ability to disperse loans. Prior to using Payments, Indicose operated almost entirely using analogue and cash payments. The SACCO administrator was eager to revitalize the organization with a new tool and believes making the transition from cash to mobile money, plus the added value of sending SMS, will be just what the organization needs to increase membership and profitability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indicose plans to send SMS notifications about upcoming meetings, automatically notify people if they’ve missed a payment, and even offer automatic SMS balance inquiries. The SACCO has acquired a Paybill account and anticipates members to begin making Paybill payments. Indicose hopes the ease and efficiency of the process will lead to member retention and expansion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of Indicose’s main challenges is that as a community-based organization seeking to reduce poverty, and they have had a hard time sanctioning nonpayers, which has negatively affected the organization as a whole. The SACCO hopes that SMS automation and cleaner financial transactions will help members to better maintain their loans and uplift not only the SACCO, but the community as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Mobile Money in the Last Mile of Kenya</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The Brookings Institute’s Financial and Digital Inclusion Project named Kenya as the top scoring country in the world for financial inclusion based on country commitment, mobile capacity, regulatory environment and adoption of traditional and digital financial services. Yet, SIMLab’s efforts to introduce to mobile money to organizations in rural Kenya have encountered significant barriers to adoption and sustained use by organizations and end-users alike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, we are releasing our case study, &lt;a href=&quot;/files/SIMLab Case Study - Mobile money in the last mile.pdf&quot;&gt;Implementing a Mobile Money Management Tool and Training Approach in the Last Mile&lt;/a&gt;, which reviews our experience implementing a mobile money software tool in rural Kenya, for a project cofunded by UK Department for International Development (DFID) through the Global Poverty Action Fund (GPAF). The project worked with 40 NGOs and SACCOs (Savings and Credit Cooperatives) in rural Kenya to make the transition from cash to mobile money in a country where 90% of households have used mobile money services. Despite this, we found that last-mile organizations are not simply awaiting a platform that suits their technical needs to incorporate digital cash into their daily business activities. Rather, complex human, organizational and environmental challenges raise serious questions about the ‘build it, and they will come’ philosophy that has driven much of the mMoney space over the last ten years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To discuss this case study and the challenges that others have faced in the space, we are hosting an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.eventbrite.com/e/introducing-mobile-money-to-organizations-in-the-last-mile-in-kenya-tickets-18356055456&quot;&gt;event&lt;/a&gt; today, September 4th, at the OpenGovHub in Washington DC. If you’re in DC, you can come by, or you can follow us on Twitter, where @SIMLab will be tweeting about it under the hashtag #lastmilemoney. We also have limited slots for a live-streaming webinar, which you can RSVP for at the above link.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to Kelly Church, SIMLab’s Project Director, the event will also feature Leo Tobias, Technology Team Manager at Grameen Foundation, presenting on their work in Uganda; Sean McDonald, CEO of FrontlineSMS, reflecting on the very real obstacles caused by fractured operator, handset and software markets; and Kay McGowan, Digital Finance Team Lead at USAID, who will offer her reflections and responses to the panelists’ presentations, and share some of the direction of USAID policy as the mMoney field approaches its ninth year. Together the panel will hopefully shed light on mobile money efforts within and beyond Kenya, and look critically at what is being done and what needs to be done at the technology and policy level to ensure the next five years will bring greater, more widespread and engaged adoption of mobile financial services.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Building A Better Everything</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In June, I had the opportunity to participate on a panel at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cyberjustice.ca/en/&quot;&gt;University of Montreal’s Cyberjustice Lab&lt;/a&gt;. I chatted about how we use our mission and values to inform our day-to-day work, and felt it might be helpful to put some of what I talked about in writing, to help explain just what it is that we do here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SIMLab works to make systems and services more accessible, responsive, and resilient. Talking to lawyers, traditionally service providers, I like to focus my framing on legal systems, to help people think a little differently. Put simply, a system has inputs and outputs that feed back into each other. These inputs and outputs can be information, behavior, money, time, widgets…and so on. So, if our mission is to improve systems, it means we measure the success of our technology projects by whether it makes a system better. (We also have to draw lines around what the system is for a given project, but that’s a topic for another day.) Our values, accessibility, responsiveness, and resilience, are how we define what “better” looks like in a system, and illuminate lessons that inform how we approach our work. So how do we think about each of those values in a more practical sense?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Measuring accessibility sounds simple: how easy is it for someone to get into a system? But sometimes this manifests in interesting ways: with the DC Public Library, we’re &lt;a href=&quot;http://simlab.org/blog/2015/05/21/first-resort&quot;&gt;working&lt;/a&gt; to help librarians deliver better information about social services, so that people can navigate the system more easily. As with any project we do, we’ve dedicated lots of time to exploring the context—here, the DC social services ecosystem—to test and revise (and revise again) our hypotheses, and embrace the limitations of the project—here, that there’s an opportunity to provide help without doing a full social work intake interview.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If accessibility is about getting in to the system, responsiveness might be what the system produces. This isn’t always improving the substance of an outcome—after all, not everyone can be happy with the outcome of a legal case—sometimes it’s simply making a system more efficient. In Odisha, India, we’re &lt;a href=&quot;http://simlab.org/blog/2015/07/23/paper-houses-digital-homes/&quot;&gt;working&lt;/a&gt; with Landesa to make it easier for supervisors and potential titleholders alike to coordinate and track a complex surveying and land titling program. Although we’re building technology, ultimately our hope is to make humans more responsive. As a result, we strive to understand who we’re creating more—or less—work for, and constantly monitor what we’ve built to see if it’s working. In other words, to build a more responsive system, we need to be responsive, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Resilience is perhaps the fuzziest-seeming value of the three. I like to describe it helping systems (and organizations) be self-propelled. So, are we helping a system—or an organization—adapt to shocks, or changes in the bigger system around it? We work with non-profits on small engagements to help them use a piece of technology better, whether it’s improving how they collect feedback from people calling a help line, creating a reminder system for clients, or connecting with clients over a different communications channel, such as SMS. Whether the project is big or small, our goal is that at the end of the day, it can run without our help, and adapt to the inevitable changes that an organization or a system will face. Resilient technologies can help make resilient organizations, and in turn, more resilient systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No matter where we work, we try to be inclusive, foster local ownership of technology, encourage good habits, generate data, and make complex processes more efficient and transparent. This isn’t always easy: systems are chaotic and messy. So, in our work, we value fluidity: how well our work fills the gaps in a system, and how well it adapts (and we adapt) to change. Because systems never stop: the flow of information, of demand for services, of need for help, is constant and unceasing, whether you’re ready to handle it or not. In that blur of motion, we think it’s critical that systems are accessible, responsive, and resilient—even if those values are hard to define, and harder to measure. As Donella Meadows, a pioneer of systems thinking, put it, “No one can define or measure justice, democracy, security, freedom, truth, or love. No one can define or measure any value. But if no one speaks up for them, if systems aren’t designed to produce them, if we don’t speak about them and point toward their presence or absence, they will cease to exist.”&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Paper Houses, Digital Homes</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;“All the land records against this wall have been scanned.” Stacks of land records—browning paper tied together with string—lined the walls, the tables, the shelves. White receipts with markered labels flopped out of some of them; processed and scanned. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tahasildar&quot;&gt;tahasildar&lt;/a&gt; beamed, visibly proud at the progress his office had made. Still, stacks of titles remained, and still more remained unrecorded. And any new records would also be delivered on paper, awaiting digitization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the state of land records in Odisha, India—and many other maturing land regimes: digital, almost. An ever-changing mix of analog and digital record-keeping further complicates the delivery of titles to landless homes. The closer one gets to a household-level record, the more likely that record is only exist on paper. The household and village level is also where tracking is most critical—not only for administrators to understand what’s working and what isn’t, but to create a transparent record of activity that potential titleholders can use to mark their own progress through a complicated process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; defer=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If information about a titling process can be made digital, in whatever form is available, that can have a transformative effect not only on how efficiently land titles are delivered to the most marginalized, but on how people understand and build their lives around land.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Odisha, SIMLab has partnered with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.landesa.org&quot;&gt;Landesa&lt;/a&gt; on a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.org&quot;&gt;Google.org&lt;/a&gt; funded project to do just that. We’re using simple mobile technology (SMS and &lt;a href=&quot;http://frontlinesms.com&quot;&gt;FrontlineCloud&lt;/a&gt;, to start) to help deliver titles to landless rural and tribal villagers across Odisha.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the last year, SIMLab staff have spent nearly three months on the ground in Odisha: interviewing officials at every stage of the land process, visiting villages that have received title under the program, conducting context assessments, iteratively designing and modifying the software in close consultation with Landesa staff, and conducting technology trainings across the state. Along the way, we’ve adjusted the program and approach to the changing context in Odisha: adjusting the scope of the program to fit technology ownership in villages and districts, reintroducing ourself to a new set of government officials after the most recent round of elections, and iterating a scaling program to meet the exciting e-governance developments in Odisha. That’s not even mentioning the cyclone that swept the state last October.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In April, we began the first round of training and implementation, and continue to monitor the pilot for results. For the pilot stage, officials and village-level workers can use SMS to report their progress (there are nearly 30 individual steps in the program, taking between 12 and 18 months to complete in total) and receive reminders of tasks that are behind schedule, while supervisors can generate and download up to the minute aggregate reports, summarizing total progress in their area. Finally, village-level officials, and villagers, can submit status queries to find out how far along their—or any—village is in the program. Because the system uses a combination of SMS and cloud-based services, we can adjust the parameters of the system (such as the number of days before a task is considered late) mid-stream. In other words, rather than replacing a process that’s already underway, we’ve created a low-touch system that allows select data to run ahead of paper surveys, hopefully reducing the latency between problem identification and problem solving from months to days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re excited about what lies ahead for this program, and for others like it. Although the technology context is difficult, we’re exploring small opportunities to reach out directly to titleholders, enabling a person to track their own application, build land literacy, or even request services via SMS. We’re also beginning to explore integration into the rapidly maturing Odisha land database, which would enable government officials to seamlessly communicate land-record changes to the local level, villagers to verify title, and perhaps open up an opportunity to communicate private land transactions back to a database.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To show how SMS and other inclusive technologies can be used to optimize large-scale land interventions, we’ve made a small demo, which will be up for a short time. You can access it by texting the word DEMO to ‭+1 (919) 582-5077. If you’re interested in working with SIMLab to bring inclusive technology to your land program, shoot us an email, at &lt;a href=&quot;&amp;#109;&amp;#097;&amp;#105;&amp;#108;&amp;#116;&amp;#111;:&amp;#107;&amp;#101;&amp;#105;&amp;#116;&amp;#104;&amp;#064;&amp;#115;&amp;#105;&amp;#109;&amp;#108;&amp;#097;&amp;#098;&amp;#046;&amp;#111;&amp;#114;&amp;#103;&quot;&gt;&amp;#107;&amp;#101;&amp;#105;&amp;#116;&amp;#104;&amp;#064;&amp;#115;&amp;#105;&amp;#109;&amp;#108;&amp;#097;&amp;#098;&amp;#046;&amp;#111;&amp;#114;&amp;#103;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Open First, Ask Later: Rethinking Data Ethics Among International Agencies, Donors, and NGOs</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Aggregating and opening data presents opportunities for deepening civic engagement, addressing decades-long environmental coordination challenges, or highlighting inefficient institutional processes and procedures, among many other potential uses, benefits and information gains. The same data, branded as a public good, is also the subject of many debates regarding risks, agency, and privacy among others. There is a rising need to sort out the ethics of use and power dynamics over decision-making when it comes to open/ing data for ‘development’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Launched in 2013, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.d4d.orange.com/en/home&quot;&gt;Data for Development Challenge&lt;/a&gt; (D4D), a challenge run by mobile network operator Orange, opens mobile phone usage data up to researchers selected to analyze it,  in order to facilitate the use of big data in key development sectors, defined in conjunction with government ministries and organizations (for example, the D4D Senegal Challenge focuses on health, agriculture, transport/urban planning, energy, and national statistics). There is an additional category, defined by Orange themselves for those “advancing anonymisation techniques to allow sharing of data that is relevant for society while respecting privacy. A constructive dialogue with the Personal Data Commission was opened up at the start of the project, focused, in part, to work on the creation of robust sharing formats and exploration of the uses and limitations of the synthetic data sets.” In 2013, the European Union committed to implementing the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/open-data-charter/g8-open-data-charter-and-technical-annex&quot;&gt;G8 Open Data Charter&lt;/a&gt;, which outlines five principles for government data: open government data by default; release as much data as possible (quantity) and then improve as needed (quality); usable by all- free, easy to access, open formats; release data for improved governance- transparency about processes and sharing of lessons learned with other governments; and release data for innovation- encourage use of open data in civil society. The EU’s open data commitments cover all grants provided by EU donor and development agencies. USAID announced its &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.usaid.gov/2014/10/announcing-usaids-open-data-policy/&quot;&gt;Open Data Policy&lt;/a&gt; in 2014, which commits all partners and subcontractors to submit any and all USAID-funded data, again open by default “with limited exceptions,” in a standardized format to their Development Data Library, tagging with relevant labels to facilitate metadata and consumer use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In each of these cases, “opening” data represents a continuum of principles, commitments, processes, and actions related to generating, organizing and sharing [and making decisions based on] information. The rapid adoption of open standards would signal their promise, and has in many ways enabled and accelerated its momentum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International organizations (non-governmental, multilateral, and bilateral) aren’t unique because of the data they work with, but because they play a unique, and often unclear role in civic, social, political, and economic life around the world - with a particularly heavy presence in conflict-affected countries and countries in transition. The number of NGOs alone operating in active conflict areas has grown exponentially in the past 30 years.  According to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.versobooks.com/books/532-the-least-of-all-possible-evils&quot;&gt;Weizman&lt;/a&gt;, “while in 1980 there were about 40 NGOs dealing with the Ethiopian famine, a decade later 250 were operating during the Yugoslavian war; by 2004, 2,500 were involved in Afghanistan.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The growing imperative among international agencies, donors, and organizations to open first and ask later needs rethinking. Here’s why:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;IOs are represented and play a role in highly sensitive, transitional or conflict-affected environments, where risks and considerations around the collection of information that is linked to an individual, even if not about that individual have different implications.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The legitimacy of international organizations’ presence, projects, and services is often derived from other international bodies, and accountability requirements are most focused on populations in countries where organizations are headquartered. How people in different countries, individually or collectively, interact with, consent to, and/or share opinions related to international organizations and institutions is by no means uniform, where present at all, unless there is a particular evaluation underway and a dedicated staff person is deployed to collect it.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There is a higher concentration of uncoordinated, and frequently evolving efforts, resulting in duplicated efforts and survey and research fatigue.  All the fragmented data associated with different initiatives, that may be de-identified by an individual organization and seem innocuous as reported, has the potential for meta-analysis which doesn’t rely on individual details.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The regulations and policies regarding data vary widely between countries, and it is unclear which country’s standards take precedent or apply.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Where standards and protocols are unclear, program staff or field office directors often make the call.  When there are standards imposed on situations for which they simply do not fit, meeting reporting obligations may take priority without clear knowledge of logic or consequences associated with decisions.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;IOs are accountable to a wide number of stakeholders, with the population they seek to serve, represent, or research coming in at the bottom of the list. They must often report to their headquarters, most likely located in another country, host governments, and donor(s).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the volume of organizations growing alongside the volume of data being produced or opened through their actions or advocacy, questions about ethical data use, protocols, and standards quickly become daunting in their sheer volume; making them all the more necessary to ask at all levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SIMLab has benefited greatly from the work that others are doing on this topic and our own work in the past, including a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.frontlinesms.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/frontlinesms_userguide.pdf&quot;&gt;data integrity guide&lt;/a&gt;, focused on data ethics when using low-end mobile technologies, published in 2011.  In the coming months, SIMLab will continue taking stock of data ethics questions and approaches in international organizations, as open data and data-driven decision-making, accelerate into accepted, even expected, standards.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>First Resort: Building social services resources at DC Public Library</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Despite the wide range of social and legal services available in American cities, it’s not always easy for a person to find the right service provider—or often, set of providers—who can help. Service providers, from lawyers to social workers to case managers, have deep expertise helping people solve problems, but sometimes, it may not be obvious that someone should, say, call a lawyer in addition to a food bank if they receive a letter that food stamp benefits have been cut off.  A single story may require the help of multiple experts, and multiple services, in order to meet a person’s need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Particularly for those on the wrong side of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S4O0MK0ZDRE&quot;&gt;digital divide&lt;/a&gt;, people often turn to the library for information on where to find help. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://dclibrary.org&quot;&gt;DC Public Library&lt;/a&gt; (DCPL) is working to better meet this need, by improving how it provides recommendations and resources on social services in the city, and equipping librarians with question-and-answer tools that can help draw out other services that a person might need. We’re excited to announce that—with support from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.knightfoundation.org/funding-initiatives/knight-prototype-fund/&quot;&gt;Knight Foundation’s Prototype Fund&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://openreferral.org&quot;&gt;Open Referral Initiative&lt;/a&gt;—SIMLab is partnering with DCPL to help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This project is, in some ways, new territory for us as well—it’s one of our first hands-on projects in the United States—and so, in close collaboration with the Library, we’ve been working hard over the past weeks to get a sense of the world we’re working in. We’ve interviewed front-line librarians to better understand the types of services people seek at the library, and the stories people tell when they do so. For this prototype, we wanted to narrow our focus to a subset of services, so we could explore more deeply within that subset and test our hypotheses and assumptions on a smaller scale. We’ve chosen to focus on on services for the elderly, a commonly requested service set at the library. The difficulty of finding elderly services is a microcosm of finding services generally: after all, most everyone gets old eventually, and many people are navigating the system for the first time, often in search of help for an aging parent, family member, or partner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This spring, SIMLab and DCPL team members have spent time together exploring the elderly services available in DC. City agencies and service providers alike have generously shared their time and experience with us, helping us to learn about some of the intake, referral, and capacity challenges that their organizations face, as well as technology tools that are currently in development to help meet those challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; defer=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From here, we’re trying to bridge the gap between a person’s story of need and the help they are seeking, or might need to seek. With librarians and social workers, we’re helping to identify questions librarians can ask to help clarify and illuminate a person’s situation. So, a request that starts with “I need daytime care for my aging parent” might yield a collection of immediate and long-term resources, from case managers and agencies who can do complete assessments to wellness and activity programs available now. We aren’t turning the library into an intake center, but trying to use technology and research to help people navigate the natural peculiarities of a complex system (like the same service having different names, depending on the provider).  We’re also helping DCPL think about how this tool might practically be deployed in a library branch, from the trainings librarians will need, to how to create a safe space where these questions can be asked, and ways to get anonymous feedback on the information provided. All the while, we’ll be focused on learning—what we’ve done well, what we can do better, what needs are yet to be met—and documenting and sharing that learning so that others can build on and replicate our work in other contexts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although this is a prototype, we’re excited about exploring these dynamics over the long-term, and on finding creative ways to help organizations use technology and work together to solve tricky problems. We’re in early days yet, but watch this space and others for more on what we learn. We’re slowly exploring challenges in the United States that we might be able to help with, from getting feedback on service referrals to reaching offline and low-literacy communities. If you’ve got a project that you think SIMLab might be a fit for, &lt;a href=&quot;&amp;#109;&amp;#097;&amp;#105;&amp;#108;&amp;#116;&amp;#111;:&amp;#104;&amp;#101;&amp;#108;&amp;#108;&amp;#111;&amp;#064;&amp;#115;&amp;#105;&amp;#109;&amp;#108;&amp;#097;&amp;#098;&amp;#046;&amp;#111;&amp;#114;&amp;#103;&quot;&gt;reach out to us&lt;/a&gt;; we’d love to hear from you.&lt;/p&gt;
