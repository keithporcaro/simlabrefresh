      <h2 id="idea-to-prototype">Idea to Prototype</h2>
<p>We’ll get you from the first spark of an idea to a concrete plan for implementing a project and evaluating its success. Our approach is intensive and as comprehensive as you need, with immersive workshops, user-centered research, rapid prototyping, and participatory requirements-building. We’ll work with you at every step of building your technology project, so that at the end of our process, you not only have a plan for the project itself, but you’re more informed about how to maintain and adjust the project to ever-changing conditions.</p>

<h2 id="technology-adoption-management">Technology Adoption Management</h2>
<p>Integrating new technology can be fraught with hidden and confounding challenges. SIMLab can help your people stay as cutting edge and innovative as your technology. We take a systems-driven approach to technology adoption and integration, helping you understand how a new piece of technology integrates into existing process and information flows, and how best to adjust to a newly digital environment. For mission-driven organizations, we can analyze and optimize the impact of new technology on your most vulnerable clients, helping to ensure that no one is left behind, and that your organizational ethics remain uncompromised.</p>

<h2 id="feedback-loops-monitoring--evaluation-documentation">Feedback Loops, Monitoring &amp; Evaluation, Documentation</h2>
<p>Opportunities for learning and improvement are everywhere, and SIMLab can help you capture them. We work with non-profits, governments, and other social change actors to build systems for collecting and acting on feedback from clients, constituents, and users, no matter where they are. Planning or running a technology project? SIMLab can design and implement a comprehensive monitoring and evaluation plan that emphasizes the larger system a technology is being implemented in, from rollout to training and support to the capacity of responding institutions. When a project is complete, we’re available to analyze, interpret, and synthesize project data, building case studies and best practice documents to help crystalize your evaluations into permanent, scalable learnings.</p>

<h2 id="policy-and-systems-analysis">Policy and Systems Analysis</h2>
<p>Nothing exists in isolation, least of all technology. Engage with us to take stock of how technology fits into your world. We work with governments and institutions to develop policy recommendations around technology, inclusion, and accountability. We audit, analyze, and optimize service and policy ecosystems, from legal processes to libraries to land titling, helping to ensure that they’re as accessible as possible. For subject-matter experts looking to apply technology to tackle the most wicked challenges in their fields, SIMLab can help build frameworks of prerequisites, risks, and best practices, to help ensure that any solution is as comprehensive and effective as possible.</p>

<h2 id="innovation-subscription">Innovation Subscription</h2>
<p>Forget hiring an overworked, underpaid tech coordinator. Tap into SIMLab’s years of knowledge building technology projects in the world’s most difficult environments. For an annual fee, we’ll embed in your organization to identify systems ripe for improvement, and continuously work with you to design, implement, and optimize technology projects tailored to your needs and budget. Because, like you, we’re a non-profit, our overriding priority is to help you achieve your mission as best as possible.</p>

<p>Want even more benefits? Join a subject matter cluster, or create your own by subscribing with peer organizations. We’ll work with your group of organizations to develop and share best practices, get discounts on contractors and services, and build innovative new projects that set new standards in your field.</p>
