#Our History
SIMLab began life as a foundation with a mission to lower barriers to social change through mobile. It grew out of the [FrontlineSMS](http://www.frontlinesms.com) project, founded by Ken Banks in 2005. With more than 200,000 downloads in 199 territories, FrontlineSMS helps tens of thousands of organizations reach tens of millions of people, customizing and owning their own content, engagement, and relationships in sectors ranging from health, to financial services, to conservation. In December 2014, we spun FrontlineSMS off into a separate social enterprise.
