title: About Us
---
Social Impact Lab (SIMLab) uses inclusive technology to help organizations make systems and services more accessible, responsive, and resilient. We provide advice and hands-on support for organizations implementing technology projects around the world. 

We believe that by focusing on siloed services and concentrated pilots in optimal conditions, technology projects fail to fulfill their true potential in helping the most marginalized. Ultimately, a person’s marginalization is not caused by the mere failure of a single service. For the most vulnerable, systemic deficiencies in essential service and support structures cascade small failures into insurmountable ones. We believe that technology can help to solve this problem, by providing the base infrastructure to help organizations and services within a system to work better together; by removing obstacles that impede systemwide responsiveness and awareness; and by better connecting those who need help the most to those who can provide it. 

Our mission and ethos, coupled with deep experience, shape key principles that inform and guide the work we take on and how we carry it out:

* Local ownership of technology is critical for a project's long-term viability;
* Start from the problem and the context, not the technology;
* Include as many people as possible by opening multiple lines of communication for engagement and feedback;
* Develop a realistic funding model and exit plan;
* Use existing platforms wherever possible, and contribute to the global toolkit where it’s not, building for replicability and respecting the real cost of software development, support and maintenance;
* Make robust, appropriate efforts to assess and document outcomes and impact;
* Share learning and methodologies under open licenses.

#Our History
SIMLab began life as a foundation with a mission to lower barriers to social change through mobile. It grew out of the [FrontlineSMS](http://www.frontlinesms.com) project, founded by Ken Banks in 2005. With more than 200,000 downloads in 199 territories, FrontlineSMS helps tens of thousands of organizations reach tens of millions of people, customizing and owning their own content, engagement, and relationships in sectors ranging from health, to financial services, to conservation. In December 2014, we spun FrontlineSMS off into a separate social enterprise.
