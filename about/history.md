Social Impact Lab (SIMLab) began life as a foundation with a mission to lower barriers to social change through mobile&mdash;it grew out of the [FrontlineSMS](http://www.frontlinesms.com) project, founded by Ken Banks in 2005. With more than 200,000 downloads in 199 territories, FrontlineSMS helps tens of thousands of organizations reach tens of millions of people, customizing and owning their own content, engagement, and relationships in sectors ranging from health, to financial services, to conservation.

As FrontlineSMS grew, we adopted a project-based model, where subject matter experts would help organizations implement FrontlineSMS and other inclusive technologies. We developed projects in health (which eventually became Medic Mobile), governance, media, radio, education, mobile money, and legal services, and grew a consulting practice from those and other sectoral expertises. As we grew, we began to realize two things: first, that the growth of FrontlineSMS was constrained by its non-profit home, as the donor environment continues to be unfriendly to improving general-purpose software, as opposed to funding new single-purpose tools, even if those tools are partially redundant; second, fueled by client demand, our consulting practice was expanding to cover work beyond implementing SMS and the Frontline toolset. 

As a result, we had two separate businesses under one roof, and to optimize the growth of both, we split them up. In December 2014, FrontlineSMS was divested to a separate, for-profit social enterprise, owned and operated by the existing FrontlineSMS team. Our consulting business remained in the original non-profit entity, which was renamed Social Impact Lab, or SIMLab. 

Although we split up the organizations, it was by no means a divorce; SIMLab and FrontlineSMS still work closely together on many projects. SIMLab has taken advantage of our new organizational structure to be truly platform-agnostic, with an expanded mission to help organizations use inclusive technologies of all stripes to make systems and services more accessible, responsive, and resilient.
